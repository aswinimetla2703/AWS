AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS (Amazon Web Services) operates a vast and highly secure global infrastructure to deliver cloud services with high availability, low latency, and resilience. It consists of the following key components:

Regions

A Region is a geographically isolated area with multiple data centers.
AWS has 33 Regions worldwide (as of 2024).
Each Region has at least three Availability Zones (AZs).


Availability Zones (AZs)

AZs are clusters of physically separate data centers within a Region.
Connected by low-latency networking to ensure high availability.
Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and security.

Edge Locations & Content Delivery

450+ Edge Locations globally for AWS CloudFront (CDN).
Reduces latency by caching content closer to users.
